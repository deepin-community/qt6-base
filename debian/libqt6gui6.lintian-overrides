# libQt6XcbQpa is actually a private library *only* used by its
# platforms plugins.
# Sadly instead of being installed into a proper place like
# /usr/lib/<arch-triplet>/qt6/ it is are being installed into /usr/lib/.
# We are still shipping the headers but they only contain the version and
# the only binaries that depend on them are shipped within this very same
# binary package, so it's safe to override these Lintian warnings.
