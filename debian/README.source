Bootstrapping the docs packages
-------------------------------

In order to generate documentation for Qt, qdoc and
qtattributionsscanner is needed. Thus you need to do
the following steps if you want to rebuild the Qt stack:

* Build only arch-dependent packages from these sources:
  - qt6-base
  - qt6-declarative
  - qt6-tools
* Build the arch-independent packages (-doc and -doc-html) of the above sources.
* Build the rest of the Qt stack in the usual way.
